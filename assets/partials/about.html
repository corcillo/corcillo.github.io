        theres so many tvs, microwaves, radios, i think -- i cant -- im not 100% sure what
        <br> we have here in stock because i cant see anything. Our prices, i hope, 
        <br>arent too low! Look at this refrigerator only $200.  How about this 
        <br>microwave, only $100, thats fair! I'm ants in my eyes johnson, everythings 
        <br>black, i cant see a thing, and also i cant feel anything either, did i 
        <br>mention that? but thats not as catchy as having ants in your eyes, so 
        <br>that always goes, you know, off by the wayside.  Its a very rare condition, 
        <br>my body doesnt allow for the sense of touch.  Am I standing, sitting, 
        <br>i dont know!
